# pandas-challenge
I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge.  I understood most of the concepts and how to get to the conclusion, unfortunately there was a binning section that was being extremly uncooperative.  I tried multiple ways and multiple time to fix.  But I am exhausted.

For this project, I followed whatever instructions were provided and did the best I could.
The observations are 2:
1. The $ spent does not necessarily mean a higher overall passing grade.  
2. School size plays a role in student success, if possible maybe expand the bins, because the data lumped 2000-5000 in one bin.  That is too much in comparison to the other bins. I created a binning#2.  It looks like students in schools that are between (1k-2k), performed the best.
